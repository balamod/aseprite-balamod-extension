# Balatro spriting tools for Aseprite
This extension package contains 3 tools, all listed in the File menu in Aseprite:
  - A Templates button that allows you to choose from a number of preset 1x scale editing templates, or create your own
  - A 'Blindify' button that will take a single image of a Blind and instantly create all the necessary animation frames for it
  - A 1x asset to 2x asset scaler that will automatically create an appropriately scaled file that you can rename freely.

## Installation
Download the fonts and the `aseprite-extension` file, and open Edit > Preferences > Extension in aseprite, and install the package by clicking add extension and choosing the file.
The fonts can be installed onto your system using the OS-specified manner, which will allow you to select them from a list, or you can keep them somewhere accessible and open them manually from the text menu in Aseprite.

Check `fonts/fonts.txt` for more information on the particulars of each font file and their usage.
